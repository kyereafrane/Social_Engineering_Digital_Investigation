The first task was to verify if the ANZ website was a safe site. This was done by verifying if there is an SSL Certificate, ie. https://. Again, made sure there was a security icon that looked like a lock visible near the address bar. <br/>

Next, I had to review emails to classify them as malicious or safe as they may contain malicious attachments, or suspicious links to gather private account information from the user.<br/>

The next task was to examine a packet capture file(pcap) conatining all recent network activities. I had to investigate the network traffic in order to determine what the user accessed and downloaded. I will then identify, gather, and report on the information contained in the pcap file. <br/>
